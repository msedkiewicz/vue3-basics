# Vue Basics repository

This repository contains exercises from first 3 modules of Udemy course Vue - The Complete Guide: https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/ by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## For developers

Vue in those repositiories is kept in a form of templates, so you don't need anything apart from IDE of your choice.
